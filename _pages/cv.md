## Research experience
# Postdoc IMAU
Since 2017, I am a postdoc researcher at IMAU, Utrecht University in the [INSeaPTION project](http://inseaption.eu/), supervised by Roderik van de Wal. This project revolves around the co-design of sea-level research with stakeholders and policy makers. The goal of the project is to produce climate services on global and local (Maldives and French Polynesia) scale. For this project, I provide the latest regional sea-level rise projections and a quantification of extreme sea level events at the coast.

# IPCC contribution
I was a Contributing Author to the latest [Special Report on the Oceans and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC)](https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/home/) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). For both Chapter 4 and the Summary for Policy Makers, I performed the calculations and produced the visualisation of future sea-level change and its impact on extreme sea level events. In December 2019, I presented the conclusions on sea-level rise in this report at the Conference of the Parties (COP25) in Madrid.

# Coastal erosion project
During 2018-2019, I managed the project *Drivers and uncertainties in future coastal erosion*. In this project, research assistant Niels Hendrikx assessed whether observed shoreline retreat could be attributed to changes in mean sea-level and/or storm surge events coincident with tidal peaks. 

## Education
# PhD work
I have completed my PhD during the period 2014-2017 at the University of Bergen, Norway with Tor Eldevik. My dissertation [*On freshwater and the density-driven circulation in the northern seas*](http://bora.uib.no/handle/1956/19042) addresses the potential positive influence of northern freshwater input on the strength and stability of the ThermoHaline Circulation (THC). In this work, I have used various models ranging from a simple box-model to a state-of-the-art global ocean model (NorESM).

# Master
I followed the Master programme *Meteorology, Physical Oceanography and Climate* (today called Climate Physics) at IMAU, Utrecht University from 2013-2014. My Master thesis is published as [*The connection of the Indonesian Throughflow, South Indian Ocean Countercurrent and the Leeuwin Current*](https://doi.org/10.5194/os-12-771-2016) and was supervised by Will P.M. de Ruijter and Dewi Le Bars. In this work, I combined simulations from an idealised numerical ocean model (HIM) with those from a high-resolution realistic model (POP) to propose a new circulation scheme connecting the South Pacific and Indian Oceans, driven by a combination of wind stress and buoyancy forcing.
