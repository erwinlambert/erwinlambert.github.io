## Polar oceanography

When warm waters in the Southern Oceans get in contact with the floating ice shelves of the Antarctic ice sheet, the ice shelves melt.

A simple model for the flow of buoyant melt plumes below ice shelves reveals a complex pattern of melt below the Thwaites ice shelf. Detailed maps like these can be used to force ice sheet models in order to project future sea-level rise.

Amplification of extreme water levels due to projected sea-level rise by 2100 under three emission scenarios from the latest IPCC report (<a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/srocc/chapter/chapter-4-sea-level-rise-and-implications-for-low-lying-islands-coasts-and-communities/">Oppenheimer et al. 2019</a>).
