## Sea-level rise

![SROCC Fig 4.2](/assets/IPCC-SROCC-CH_4_2.jpg "SROCC Fig 4.2")
The above figure shows the projected global mean sea-level rise for the coming three centuries. The colours indicate the greenhouse gas emission scenarios: a low-emission scenario (blue) and a high-emission scenario (red).

My research revolves into accurately estimating the uncertainty in these projections on a global and regional scale. This can help policy makers in their planning strategies of both mitigation and adaptation.
